# Twilio IoT Deployed Devices for the Multi-Tech MultiConnect® Dragonfly™

You can find our detailed Quickstart for the MultiConnect® Dragonfly™ on our [Documentation site](https://www.twilio.com/docs). You can clone this code directly to the Arm Mbed Web IDE [through this link](https://os.mbed.com/users/pkamp/code/MTS_Dragonfly_Twilio_Sync_IoT_MQTT/).

If you copy manually, it depends on a few libraries:
* [Mbed Official SDK](https://os.mbed.com/users/mbed_official/code/mbed/)
* [EclipseTM Paho Embedded Client](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/code/MQTT/)
* [Mbed JSON Value](https://os.mbed.com/users/samux/code/MbedJSONValue/)
* [Fork of MultiTech's mtsas](https://os.mbed.com/users/miaotwilio/code/mtsas/)


Change the `sync_key` and `sync_password` to Device Key credentials from Twilio.

Make sure the `BoardLED` Document exists and you should be ready to flash, but check out the above linked Quickstart for additional help.
