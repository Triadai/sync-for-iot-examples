# Twilio IoT Deployed Devices for the Seeed Studio LinkIt ONE

You can find our detailed [Quickstart for Deployed Devices on the LinkIt ONE](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/deployed-devices/mqtt-linkit-one-sync-deployed-devices) on our [Documentation site](https://www.twilio.com/docs).

`root.crt` should be copied to the root filesystem of the LinkIt, along with the decrypted client key and cert from Twilio.  Name those `client.key` and `client.crt`.

Make sure the `BoardLED` Document exists and you should be ready to flash, but check out the above linked Quickstart for additional help.
