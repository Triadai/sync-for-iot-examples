# Twilio IoT Deployed Devices for the Particle Electron

You can find our detailed [Quickstart for Deployed Devices on the Particle Electron](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/deployed-devices/mqtt-particle-electron-twilio-deployed-devices) on our [Documentation site](https://www.twilio.com/docs). You can clone this code directly to the Particle Web IDE [through this link](https://go.particle.io/shared_apps/59af932d029f70ecdb000f9b).

Be sure to install the `ArduinoJson` and `MQTT-TLS.h` libraries.

Change the `sync_key` and `sync_password` to Device Key credentials from Twilio.

Make sure the `BoardLED` Document exists and you should be ready to flash, but check out the above linked Quickstart for additional help.
